# iWorkout
This is the Android Studio version of iWorkout project. In this project, we have used WICED Sense to collect real-time sensor data, and built Bluetooth connection between WICED Sense and Android smart phone. In the Android application, we have implement DSP algorithm to analyze the sensor data, and the exercise data would be sent to the server deployed on EC2 server.
