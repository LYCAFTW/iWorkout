# iWorkout
This is the Android Studio version of iWorkout project. In this project, we have used WICED Sense to collect real-time sensor data, and built Bluetooth connection between WICED Sense and Android smart phone. The exercise data after data preprocssing will send to the server deployed on EC2 server.
